# Network Namespace as Router

This project demonstrates how to create a network namespace that functions as a router between other network namespaces in Linux.  We'll utilize virtual Ethernet cables, a bridge interface, iptables rules, and routing table rules to achieve this.

## Introduction

This project provides a practical example of setting up network routing between isolated network namespaces using basic Linux networking tools. This is a fundamental concept in network virtualization and containerization, allowing for complex network topologies on a single host.

## What are Linux Namespaces?

Linux namespaces are a kernel feature that provides process isolation by giving each process its own view of system resources. These resources include:

* **Mount points:** Each namespace can have its own filesystem hierarchy.
* **Process IDs:** Processes in different namespaces can have the same PID without conflict.
* **Network interfaces:** Each namespace can have its own network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables.
* **Inter-process communication (IPC):** IPC resources like semaphores and shared memory are also namespaced.
* **UTS (hostname and domain name):** Each namespace can have its own hostname.
* **User IDs:** User and group IDs can be namespaced, allowing for different user privileges in different namespaces.

## Importance in Containerization

Namespaces are a cornerstone of containerization technologies like Docker and LXC. They provide the isolation necessary for containers to operate independently, as if they were separate virtual machines.  Specifically, network namespaces are crucial for:

* **Network Isolation:** Containers can have their own network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables, preventing them from interfering with each other's network traffic.
* **Port Mapping:** Containers can expose ports to the host or other networks using port mapping, even if they use the same ports internally.
* **Network Namespaces as Routers:** As demonstrated in this project, network namespaces can act as routers, enabling communication between containers and/or the external network.

## Components

### Network Namespaces

Isolated network environments within the Linux kernel. Each namespace has its own set of network interfaces, routing tables, and iptables rules.

### Virtual Ethernet Cables (veth)

Pair of virtual network interfaces that act like a direct network connection between two namespaces or a namespace and the host. Data sent on one end is received on the other.

### Bridge Interface

A virtual network device that acts like a network switch. It forwards traffic between connected interfaces, allowing devices on different interfaces to communicate.

### iptables

A powerful firewall utility that allows you to configure rules for filtering and manipulating network traffic.  We'll use it here for Network Address Translation (NAT) and forwarding.

### Route Tables

Tables that determine how network traffic is routed to its destination. We'll configure routing rules to direct traffic between namespaces via the router namespace.

## Implementation

The implementation steps would typically involve:

1. **Creating Network Namespaces:** Using the `ip netns add` command.
2. **Creating veth Pairs:** Using the `ip link add` command to create veth pairs and moving one end of each pair into the respective namespaces.
3. **Setting IP Addresses:** Assigning IP addresses to the interfaces within each namespace.
4. **Creating the Bridge Interface:** Using the `brctl addbr` and `ip addr add` commands.
5. **Adding Interfaces to the Bridge:** Using the `brctl addif` command.
6. **Configuring IP Forwarding:** Enabling IP forwarding in the router namespace.
7. **Setting up iptables Rules:** Configuring NAT (Network Address Translation) and forwarding rules to allow traffic to flow between namespaces and to the external network (if needed).
8. **Configuring Route Tables:** Adding appropriate routes in each namespace to direct traffic to the router namespace.

(Detailed commands and configurations would be included in the actual project files)

## Why Learn This?

Understanding network namespaces and routing is crucial for anyone working with:

* **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes, etc. rely heavily on these concepts.
* **Network Virtualization:** Creating virtual networks and network appliances.
* **System Administration:** Troubleshooting network issues and configuring complex network setups.
* **DevOps:** Automating network configurations and deployments.
